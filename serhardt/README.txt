Name = Stewart Erhardt
Course = CSCI471

Nothing special for compilation required.  I tried only with `localhost` as the hostname
and it seems to work well.  I have included a data file to test: the US constitution as a
very simple HTML file.  I don't know my Isengard username, so I just use serhardt.
